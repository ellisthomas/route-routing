It runs diagonally from I-57, 10 miles (16 km) south of Marion, Illinois, to Chattanooga, Tennessee, at I-75.[2] As an even-numbered Interstate, it is signed as an east–west route, though the route follows a more southeast–northwest routing. Because the routing of I-24 is diagonal, the numbering is a bit unusual as it does not completely follow the Interstate Highway System numbering conventions.";
